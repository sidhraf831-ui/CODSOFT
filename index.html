      HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are the core technologies of web development. HTML provides the structure of a webpage by defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links, while CSS enhances the appearance by controlling colors, fonts, layouts, and overall design. Together, they work hand in hand to create websites that are both functional and visually appealing. HTML builds the foundation, and CSS adds style, making the user experience attractive, responsive, and engaging.
